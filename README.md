# Data-Visualizations-with-IBM-Cognos-and-Excel

Project Scenario: 

I roleplay as a regional manager for a chain of car dealerships and create visualizations from a sample dataset using Excel and
a dashboard using IBM Cognos Analytics with Watson to highlight trends between car sales and profits for
each car dealer.

The Excel file contains the sample dataset and pivot tables in separate sheets. 

IBM Cognos Analytics Dashboard can be accessed from my IBM Cloud server using this link:
