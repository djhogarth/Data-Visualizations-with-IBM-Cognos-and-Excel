# Data-Visualizations-with-IBM-Cognos-and-Excel

Project Scenario: 

I roleplay as a regional manager for a chain of car dealerships and create visualizations from a sample dataset using Microsoft Excel and
create a dashboard using IBM Cognos Analytics to allow me to understand the car sales and profits for each dealer as well
as the performance of the sales and service departments.

The .XLSX file in this repository contains the sample data and the pivot tables in separate sheets. 

The IBM Cognos Analytics dashboards can be downloaded as a PDF from using this IBM Cloud server link:
